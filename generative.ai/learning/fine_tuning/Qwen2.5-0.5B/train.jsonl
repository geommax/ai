{"instruction": "What is the capital of Myanmar?", "input": "", "output": "The capital of Myanmar is Naypyidaw. It has been the capital since 2006, replacing Yangon (Rangoon) as the administrative center."}
{"instruction": "Explain what machine learning is in simple terms.", "input": "", "output": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed. It finds patterns in data and uses them to make predictions or decisions."}
{"instruction": "Write a Python function to calculate factorial.", "input": "", "output": "```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 1\n    return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example\nprint(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n```"}
{"instruction": "Summarize the benefits of exercise.", "input": "", "output": "Exercise provides numerous benefits: improved cardiovascular health, better mental health and mood, stronger muscles and bones, weight management, better sleep quality, increased energy levels, and reduced risk of chronic diseases."}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?", "input": "", "output": "Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation) and use square brackets []. Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed) and use parentheses (). Tuples are faster and use less memory. Use lists when you need to modify data, tuples when data should remain constant."}
{"instruction": "Translate to Myanmar: Good morning", "input": "", "output": "မင်္ဂလာ မနက်ခင်းပါ (Mingalar Manekhinbar)"}
{"instruction": "What are the three states of matter?", "input": "", "output": "The three fundamental states of matter are: 1) Solid - has fixed shape and volume, 2) Liquid - has fixed volume but takes the shape of its container, 3) Gas - has no fixed shape or volume and expands to fill its container."}
{"instruction": "Write a haiku about programming.", "input": "", "output": "Code flows like water\nBugs hide in the smallest lines\nDebug, compile, run"}
{"instruction": "What is photosynthesis?", "input": "", "output": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (food) and oxygen. It occurs mainly in the leaves using chlorophyll, the green pigment that captures light energy."}
{"instruction": "Explain the concept of recursion.", "input": "", "output": "Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems. Each recursive call works on a simpler version until reaching a base case that stops the recursion. Example: calculating factorial where factorial(n) = n × factorial(n-1)."}
